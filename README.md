# Image classification, MNIST digits

## Description

### MNIST is a widely used dataset of handwritten digits that contains 60,000 handwritten digits for training a machine learning model and 10,000 handwritten digits for testing the model. It was introduced in 1998 and has become a standard benchmark for classification tasks. It is also called the “Hello, World” dataset as it’s very easy to use. MNIST was derived from an even larger dataset, the NIST Special Database 19 which not only contains digits but also uppercase and lowercase handwritten letters.

## Libraries required for development:

* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* sklearn

## Script explanation:

### The script starts by importing the data and separating it into training and testing information, initially we use the model for a single class and test the validation of the model, then we make a model for multiclass and test the model, we use heatmap to check where the model is most I fail. And finally we add conditions to the model, using the values ​​guessed by the model.
